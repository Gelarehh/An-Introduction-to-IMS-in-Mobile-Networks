# An Introduction to IMS in Mobile Networks

A brief study on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) in mobile networks is presented here.

After going through this study, one will be able to answer the following questions:

* What is the IMS structure?
* What are the purpose and tasks of IMS?
* What are the key protocols of IMS?
* Why an operator needs IMS, and what is its relation with the core network?

>A comprehensive paper on this subject is the white paper from Ericsson, available in the repository.
