# An-Introduction-to-IMS-in-Mobile-Networks

A short survey on the concept of IMS in mobile networks is prepared and presented.

After going through the survey, one will be able to answer the following questions:

* What is the IMS structure?
* What are the purpose and tasks of IMS?
* What are the key protocols of IMS?
* Why an operator needs IMS, and what is its relation with the core network?

>The primary reference used to prepare this survey is a white paper on the same topic from Ericsson, available in the repository.
